            <h3>Welcome to our virtual pet adoption site! Once you create a household & an account, you can sign in and adopt dogs. Each dog will have a happiness, hunger, thirst, energy, and potty rating. Your task will be to ensure their needs are met daily, by interacting with each of your dogs! Hope this provides a lovely little brain break from work and that the gifs of doggos will boost your mood!</h3>
